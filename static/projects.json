So one of my favourite activities (besides playing <a href='https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154925694480719&set=pb.576250718.-2207520000.1512160695.&type=3&theater'>strategy games</a> with my kids and making <a href='https://www.strava.com/activities/1231186898'>long open water swims</a>) is to complete small tech projects. Even better if they are useful."
